# What is "Randomized!"?

It's just to make the act of picking something random prettier.
It's made to run on low end computers and only works when in focus.

# Download

Required: Java (Either Java SE 8 or any JDK after 8)

1. Download the "Default Installation" .zip or .tar
2. Unzip or... untar the "Default Installation"
3. Double click on Randomized.jar

There has been issues where java fails to run Randomized.jar.
If that is the case, use Randomized.bat (Windows) or Randomized.sh (Linux)

# Usage and Modification

"open.txt" is what is shown when opened or refreshed.
It has two sections, the Title and the Additional.

Title is what is displayed prominantly and what is used when searching for the image.
Additional is displayed underneath in all modes but 1. It's just for clarification.

There are additional Keybinds...
- [ Space ] Roll
- [ {Letter} ] Finds the first {0} starting with that letter
- [ Up Arrow 'or' Down Arrow ] Select Next/Previous
- [ Enter ] Refresh the list from "open.txt"
- [ Backspace ] Removes Selected
- [ Left Arrow ] Undo (for Backspace)
- [ Right Arrow ] Exports the current list as "export.txt"
- [ 1/2/3/4 ] Change between mode/scaling

Closing the window will save the list as "close.txt"

# Caution

The text file's must be LF (as of now).

# Complete!

If I add anything, it will be a text document with the inputs.
